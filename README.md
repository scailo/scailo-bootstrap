Whether you're setting up a new environment or updating existing records, this tool ensures a smooth, automated process.

## Authentication

Before running the tool, you must configure your Scailo credentials. These are stored in a `.env` file located in the root of your working directory.

## Examples

### 1. Download CSV Templates

```bash
scailo-bootstrap --mode=download --dir=templates
```

This will download all required CSV templates into the `templates/` folder.

---

### 2. Upload CSV Data

```bash
scailo-bootstrap --mode=upload --dir=uploads --should-verify=true --should-approve=true
```

This uploads all supported CSV files from the `uploads/` directory, verifying and approving the records as specified.

---

### 3. Upload with Custom `.env` File

```bash
scailo-bootstrap --mode=upload --dir=uploads --should-verify=true --should-approve=true --env-file=.env
```

Specifies a custom `.env` file for credentials and server URL.

---

## Custom Form Field Workflow

Scailo allows users to define custom form sections and fields. Here's how to incorporate them into your data upload process:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Download Templates**

   ```bash
   scailo-bootstrap --mode=download --dir=templates
   ```

2. **Setup Form Fields**
   Copy the following files from the `templates/` folder to a new directory:

   * `formsections.csv`
   * `formfields.csv`

3. **Fill and Upload Form Fields**
   Populate the above CSVs with your custom fields, then run:

   ```bash
   scailo-bootstrap --mode=upload --dir=form-definitions
   ```

4. **Re-Download Templates**
   Download the templates again to refresh them with your custom field definitions.

   ```bash
   scailo-bootstrap --mode=download --dir=updated-templates
   ```

5. **Populate and Upload Final Data**
   Copy the relevant files from `updated-templates/` into a new folder, fill in your data, and run the upload again:

   ```bash
   scailo-bootstrap --mode=upload --dir=final-data --should-verify=true --should-approve=true
   ```

---

## Idempotency Guarantee

Uploads via this tool are **idempotent**. If a record with the same `CODE` already exists, it is **safely skipped** during upload. This means:

* You can upload the same file multiple times without causing duplication
* It is safe to re-run the upload command at any point
